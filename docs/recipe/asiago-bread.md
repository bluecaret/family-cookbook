## Steps

1. In large bowl, combine 1-1/2 cups of the flour, yeast, sugar, salt and pepper. Melt butter in milk to 120-130 degrees. Stir milk mixture into flour mix until smooth. Stir in 1 cup cheese.
2. Gradually stir in about 2 cups flour to make soft dough. Knead in mixer or by hand until smooth and elastic, adding flour if needed.
3. Oil large bowl, add dough, turn to coat. Cover with clean damp towel and let double. (It may take 2-1/2 hours, must be the cheese.).
4. Punch down, form into 2 long thin loaves. Spray baking sheet, (sprinkled with cornmeal?) Or use baguette pans. Place loaves on pan, let raise, covered, until doubled (45 min.) Preheat oven to 375.
5. Slash dough with serrated knife. Brush with lightly beaten egg and sprinkle top with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. (basil, parsley, opt.) Bake 30-35 minutes till done. Cool on rack.
