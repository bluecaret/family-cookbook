## Steps

1. Heat 1⁄2 tablespoon olive oil in a sauté pan or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. When hot, add the prosciutto strips. Cook until lightly crisp, about 1 minute.
2. Add the spinach, peppers. Cook until the spinach is fully wilted, about 2 to 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Reserve.
3. Lay the chicken breasts flat on a cutting board. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
4. Divide the spinach mixture and cheese among the breasts, cheating the components toward the top of the chicken. Wrap one end of the chicken around the mix and roll tightly, as if making a burrito. Secure the ends with toothpicks.
5. Combine the eggs in a shallow bowl. Mix the bread crumbs on a plate with salt and pepper. Dredge the chicken first in the eggs, then in the crumbs, making sure they're fully coated.
6. Wipe out the skillet. Heat the remaining oil in the pan over medium heat. Add the chicken and cook on all sides until the crust is golden brown and the chicken is cooked all the way through, about 10 minutes.
