## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 325°. For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25º. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, lightly beat the egg white with a tea spoon until foamy. Add sugar, vanilla, and salt and mix everything.
3. Add coconut and stir until well mixed. You should be able to form balls with two teaspoons. They should be moist and sticky but egg white shouldn’t be too visible because egg whites are runny once they are heated in the oven. Each egg white size is different, so you may need to adjust the consistency with additional sugar or coconut.
4. Roughly divide into 8 parts. Form into balls with two teaspoons and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining mixture, placing macaroons about 1 inch apart.
5. Bake them until slightly golden, about 15-20 minutes.
6. Remove baking sheet from oven to a wire rack, and let macaroons cool on baking sheet.
7. Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a pan of boiling water. I used the microwave method: put the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl and keep stirring the chocolate every 15 seconds until the chocolate is melted and smooth. Do not overcook chocolate in the microwave.
8. Dip the bottom of macaroons into the chocolate and place them on the parchment paper to dry. If you still have extra chocolate left, drizzle the tops with chocolate for aesthetics. Let the macaroons sit until the chocolate has dried. Enjoy!
