## Steps

“Traditional” No-Knead Method: The traditional no knead method uses long proofing times (8 to 12 hours) to develop flavor and was designed to be baked in a Dutch oven. The purpose of the Dutch oven is to emulate a baker’s oven by trapping the moisture from the dough in a “screaming” hot, enclosed environment. It’s an excellent method for making artisan quality bread.

1. Mix together cool water, salt, yeast. Add flour and mix.
2. Cover with plastic wrap, proof for 8-24 hours.
3. De-gas and dust with flour.
4. Spray bottoms and sides of two loaf pans. Place in one pan and use the other as a lid, securing with binder clips.
5. Proof for 30-60 minutes.
6. Cook for 40 minutes at 400°.
7. Remove top pan. Cook for 5-10 more minutes.
8. Let cool for 2+ hours.
