## Steps

1. Adjust an oven rack to the middle position and heat the oven to 350Â°.
2. Lightly coat a 9x13 inch cake pan with vegetable oil spray, then line the bottom with parchment paper.
3. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices, and salt together in a large bowl and set aside.
4. Whisk the eggs and sugars together in a large bowl until frothy and the sugar is mostly dissolved, about 1 minute.
5. While whisking, slowly add the oil until the mixture is thoroughly combined and emulsified, about 1 minute.
6. Whisk in the flour mixture until no streaks of flour remain.
7. Stir in the carrots.
8. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake until a wooden skewer inserted into the center comes out with a few crumbs, 35-40 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through baking.
9. Let the cake cool in the pan on a wire rack, about 2 hours. Run a pairing knife around the perimeter of the pan, invert the cake onto the rack, peel off the parchment, then invert the cake again onto a serving platter.

### Cream Cheese Frosting

This frosting is not stiff enough to hold a layer cake together. However it works great on a 9x13 inch sheet cake or 24 cupcakes.

1. Process the cream cheese, butter, sour cream, and vanilla in a food processor until combined, about 5 seconds.
2. Add the confectioners' sugar and continue to process until smooth, about 10 seconds, scraping down the bowl and blades as needed.

**Variation: Orange Cream Cheese Frosting** substitute 1 tbsp orange juice for the sour cream and 1 tbsp grated orange zest for the vanilla.

## Versatile Carrot Cake

This cake can be everything to everyone - a sheet cake, layer cake, cupcakes, or even a Bundt cake. The only difference is the baking time. If making a layer cake, you'll need to use a classic frosting, because the cream cheese frosting isn't stiff enough. As for the Bundt cake variation, be sure to gussy it up with Cream Cheese Glaze or dust it with confectioners' sugar before serving.

For two 8 inch cake layers: Reduce the baking time to 25-30 minutes.

For a Bundt Cake, increase the baking time to about 55 minutes.

For 24 cupcakes, reduce the baking time to 30 minutes.

## Variations

### Ginger-Orange Carrot Cake

1. Reduce the amount of cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon and add 1-1/2 teaspoons ground ginger to the flour mixture in step 3.
2. Add 1 tablespoon grated orange zest to the egg and sugar mixture in step 4.
3. Stir 1/2 cup finely chopped crystallized ginger into the batter with the carrots in step 7.

## To make ahead

After the cake has cooled, it can be wrapped tightly in plastic wrap and kept at room temperature for up to 3 days.
