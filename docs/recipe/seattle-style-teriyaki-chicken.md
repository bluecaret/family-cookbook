## Steps

### Marinate chicken

1. In a small bowl whisk together soy sauce, brown sugar, rice vinegar, water, garlic and ginger.
2. Pour half of the mixture over chicken in a large bowl (or in a zip-close plastic bag) and let marinate for at least 2 hours, or preferable over night. Reserve the other half of the marinade to finish at cooking time.

### Cook chicken

1. Place the remaining marinade in a small pot over medium heat. Add the cornstarch and whisk until dissolved.
2. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 3-4 minutes, until it just begins to thicken. Remove from heat and set aside.
3. Heat a grill or cast-iron pan over high heat and cook 6-7 minutes on each side to get a nice sear.
4. Brush the teriyaki sauce on.
5. Place the chicken under a hot broiler for another 3-4 minutes on each side or until juices run clear. The sauce will get sticky and caramelize—don’t let it burn.
6. Let chicken rest 10 minutes, slice into 3/4-inch pieces across the grain.
7. Garnish with green onions and sesame seeds.

Serve with cabbage salad, sticky rice, and pickles.

## Notes

- This recipe has been adjusted from the original source. It was cut in half to support 4 chicken thighs (or 2 chicken thighs with extra sauce leftover). The brown sugar has been cut in half. The ginger has been lowered a bit.
