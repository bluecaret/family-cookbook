## Steps

1. Drain and dry the tofu with a few pieces of paper towel. Then cut into cubes.
2. Whisk 1 egg and add to the tofu, season with a pinch of salt. Gently mix the tofu and eggs to coat thoroughly. Set aside.
3. In a small bowl, whisk all the ingredients for the sauce. Set aside.
4. Heat 2 – 3 tbsp cooking oil in a big pan on high to medium heat. Once hot, add garlic, ginger, and the white part of the green onion. Saute for 30 – 45 sec or until fragrant (watch it closely so it doesn’t burn).
5. Add tofu to the pan, count 5 – 7 Mississippis while the egg mixture on the bottom set a little bit. Then gently flip a few times. Cook all sides of the tofu for about 2 – 3 minutes or until golden brown (it doesn’t have to be perfect).
6. Turn the heat down to low and slowly pour in the sauce. The liquid should begin to become sticky immediately. Turn off the heat. Gently stir until the sauce thoroughly coats everything.
7. Garnish with the green parts of the green onion and sesame seeds (optional). Enjoy!
