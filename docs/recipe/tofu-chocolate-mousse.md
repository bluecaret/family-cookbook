## Steps

1. Add all of the ingredients to a high-speed blender or food processor and blend until everything is completely smooth. Stop and scrape down the sides as necessary.
2. Using a rubber spatula, pour and scrape the mixture into a glass jar or container and let chill for 2 hours or overnight. This will allow it to thicken.
3. Spoon into a small bowl or serving dishes and top with your favorite berries, chopped nuts, chocolate shavings, or a little whipped cream.

## Notes

Use silken tofu, not regular tofu for the creamy texture.

For a quicker dessert, chill only till cool or for about 30 minutes, this will result in more of a pudding texture.

You can sub cocoa powder for melted chocolate. Use 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips and melt in the microwave in 20-second increments. Add melted chocolate to the food processor with the other ingredients and follow original directions.

Cover and store leftovers in fridge for up to 3 days.
