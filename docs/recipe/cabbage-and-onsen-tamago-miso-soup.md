## Steps

1. Boil water with hondashi, and onion.
2. Once boiling, reduce heat to medium low and cook covered for 4-5 minutes.
3. Add cabbage and cook, covered, until both the onion and cabbage are tender, about 4-5 minutes.
4. While cooking onion and cabbage, prepare the onsen tamago with 3 large eggs. We'll poach one egg at a time. First crack 1 egg in a small microwave safe glass bowl similar in shape to a rice or miso soup bowl. Next pour some water **around the edges** of the bowl, pushing the egg to the center.
5. Pour enough water on top of the egg yolk to submerge it completely. Gently puncture the yolk with a toothpick to keep it from exploding during cooking.
6. Place bowl at edge of microwave. Microwave at **500W** for 90 seconds or until the egg white JUST solidifies and turns white. Yolk should be pinkish and runny at this stage. DO NOT OVERCOOK.
7. Immediately scoop out the onsen tamago with a slotted spoon, drain the water, and transfer to a small bowl. Don't keep the egg in the cooking water as teh remaining heat will continue to cook it. Repeat for the remaining eggs.
8. When cabbage is tender, turn off heat and add Miso in a laddle and stir in miso into soup till dissolved.
9. Serve the miso soup in individual bowls. Place the onsen tamago on top. Garnish with green onions.
