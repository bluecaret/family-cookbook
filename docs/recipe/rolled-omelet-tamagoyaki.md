## Steps

1. Whisk eggs and other ingredients in a bowl.
2. In a Tamagoyaki pan, pour a thin layer of the eggs, covering the whole pan.
3. Wait for eggs to set, then starting from one end, roll egg towards the other end.
4. Pour another layer of the egg into pan.
5. Gently lift up the rolled egg to allow new layer to go under it slightly.
6. Wait for layer to set, and roll again.
7. Add a final layer of egg, let set, and roll.
8. After the final layer has been rolled, push the roll against the sides of the pan to sear slightly and ensure the rolls will stay together.
9. Let cool, then cut into thin slices and serve.
