## Steps

### Make the Scald

1. In a large bowl combine all the scald ingredients and whisk until smooth.
2. Cover and leave to cool down to about 77°. _See notes._

### Make the dough

1. Add the yeast and egg yolk to the scald and whisk until smooth.
2. Add the flour and mix to a dough.
3. Switch to a clean bowl and chill in fridge, covered, for 15 minutes.
4. Fold #1: Fold the dough
5. Chill in fridge, covered, for 15 minutes.
6. Fold #2: Fold the dough
7. Cold ferment (leave in fridge, covered) for 12-24 hours. _See notes._
8. Grease a baking tin (with butter)
9. Shape the dough, and place in tin.
10. Proof, covered with plastic wrap, for 2 to 2-1/2 hours.

### Prepare and bake

1. Glaze the top of the bread with egg white.
2. Bake in pre-heated oven at 320° with fan on for 45 minutes.
3. Remove loaf from tin.
4. _Optionally spray with water liberally to soften the crust._
5. Place loaf back in oven for 5 more minutes.
6. _Optionally brush whole loaf with olive oil for a nice shine and to soften crust further._
7. Let cool at least an hour before slicing.

## Notes

**Pan Size:** This loaf will fit in 1.5lb (680g) or 2lb (900g) tins perfectly.

**Dough temperature:** We are aiming for a final dough temperature of around 25C (77F), so let the scald come down to that temperature. It will take around 3 hours. Alternatively, you could use less boiling water in the scald and top it up with cold water to balance the temperature if you want to speed up the process.

**Cold fermenting and an alternative option:** The longer you cold ferment the tastier it will be. If you don’t want to cold ferment this dough, then let it bulk ferment at room temperature for 2 hours or until it has doubled and continue as per recipe.
