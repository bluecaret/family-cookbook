## Steps

1. To prepare fish: Combine chili powder, lime juice, oil, cumin, onion powder, garlic powder, salt and pepper in a small bowl. Rub chili rub all over fish. Let stand 20 to 30 minutes for the fish to absorb the flavor.
2. To prepare coleslaw: Combine sour cream, mayonnaise, cilantro, lime zest, lime juice, sugar, salt and pepper in a medium bowl; mix until smooth and creamy. Add cabbage and toss to combine. Refrigerate until ready to use.
3. Preheat grill to medium-high.
4. Oil the grill grates (see Tip) or use a grilling basket. Grill the fish until it is cooked through and easily flakes with a fork, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer the fish to a platter and separate into large chunks.
5. Serve the tacos family-style by passing the fish, coleslaw and tortillas on the table.

## Note

Mildly spicy dried chiles, such as ancho or New Mexico, add moderate heat and rich flavor to dishes. Look for whole dried chiles in the produce section of large supermarkets and New Mexico or ancho chili powder in the spice section of large supermarkets or online.

Mahi-mahi (also called dorado) from the U.S. Atlantic and halibut from the Pacific are both sustainably fished.

Two ways to warm corn tortillas: (1) Microwave: Wrap stacks of up to 12 tortillas in barely damp paper towels; microwave on High for 30 to 45 seconds. Wrap tortillas in a clean towel to keep warm. (2) Oven: Wrap stacks of 6 tortillas in foil; place in a 375Â°F oven for 10 to 15 minutes. Wrap tortillas in a clean towel to keep warm.

To oil grill grates, dip a folded paper towel in cooking oil, hold it with tongs and rub it over the grates. Do not use cooking spray on a hot grill.
