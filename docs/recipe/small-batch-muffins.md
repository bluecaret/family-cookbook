## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Line a muffin tin with six muffin liners, use the center holes.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
4. Add milk, egg, and oil to the dry ingredients.
5. Stir until just incorporated, don’t overmix.
6. Scoop into prepared muffin tin, and bake for 15-18 minutes.

## Notes

This recipe is great as a base for any type of muffins you want. Try flavors such as vanilla, lemon, blueberry, cardamon, chocolate, seeds and more.

I recommend using the center six holes of your muffin pan when making this recipe for even baking.

These plain muffins are best served warm, right out of the oven. Pop them in the microwave (one at a time) for a few seconds to warm them back up if desired.

Can freeze up to 3 months.
