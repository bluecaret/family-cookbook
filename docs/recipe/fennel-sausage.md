## Steps

1. In a medium mixing bowl, combine all of the ingredients. Using your hand, mix thoroughly for 1 minute, until the pork becomes sticky and the ingredients are fully mixed. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, to allow the flavors to meld.
2. Form into patties or add to your recipe as outlined in the instructions of the recipe.
3. To cook, preheat a pan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil and sauté until cooked through and the outside is starting to turn golden brown and crispy, about 7 to 9 minutes.
