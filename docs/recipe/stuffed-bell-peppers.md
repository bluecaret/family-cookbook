## Steps

1. Combine taco filler (see [taco filler](./taco-filler.md) recipe), cheddar cheese, cilantro, and frozen corn to bowl and mix well.
2. Cut tops of bell peppers and empty the insides. Stuff mixture into bell peppers.
3. Roast on a sheet pan in the oven at 350Â° for about 20-40 minutes till mixture is heated thoroughly and peppers are nicely roasted.

Alternatively you can roast the bell peppers part way prior to stuffing to decrease the time the stuffing is cooked. Or try cutting the bell peppers sideways into a "boat" shape instead to speed up cooking times.
