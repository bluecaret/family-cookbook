## Steps

1. Heat saucepan with the butter, sugar and milk over medium high to high (enough to bring the syrup to a boil). Stir frequently to prevent burning.
2. Once butter is melted and the syrup has reached a full rolling boil, cook for 1 minute then remove from heat.
3. Add vanilla and cocoa and stir to combine with the syrup. Then add the oats and coconut and stir until evenly coated.
4. Drop by spoonfuls onto waxed paper and allow to cool and set up for at least an hour. ! usually make mine in the evening and allow my chocolate no bake cookies to set up over night.
