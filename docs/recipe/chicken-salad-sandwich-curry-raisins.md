## Steps

1. Cover the raisins with hot water and soak for at least 10 minutes (the warm water will help the raisins plump up); drain and place in a large bowl.
2. Add the chicken, celery, onion, carrot, curry powder, and mayonnaise. Mix well and season with salt and pepper.
3. Place the lettuce leaves on top of 4 bread slices, then top with tomatoes, chicken salad, and the remaining bread.

## Tip

Curry powder is as ubiquitous throughout Indian cooking as it is diverse, with each cook preferring a different blend of spices such as coriander, cumin, fennel, and cardamom. One thing they nearly all have in common is that distinctive yellow tinge, which comes from turmeric, perhaps the world's healthiest spice. Studies have shown turmeric's vast antioxidant portfolio to be an effective defense against arthritis, prostate and colon cancers, and various other diseases. Get your dose by rubbing curry onto chicken and fish; mixing with yogurt, garlic, and ginger for a sauce or dip; or coating roasted nuts.
