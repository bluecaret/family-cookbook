## Steps

1. Gather all the ingredients. I recommend making this dish right before you serve.
2. Beat egg in a bowl or measuring cup. Cut green onion/scallion into thin, round pieces.
3. In a small bowl, mix together 2 tsp water and 1 tsp potato starch or cornstarch to make a slurry. As the starch tends to sink to the bottom of the bowl, you will need to mix it again right before you use it.
4. To a saucepan, add dashi (Japanese soup stock), sake, and salt.
5. Add soy sauce. Check the flavor and adjust with more salt, if needed. Then, bring it to a simmer on medium heat. When simmering, give the slurry mixture another whisk and add it to the dashi.
6. Stir quickly to distribute the slurry into the dashi. Bring it to a simmer.
7. Once simmering, slowly pour a thin stream of the beaten egg into the soup in circular pattern. Let the egg sit for 20â€“25 seconds. Then, remove the saucepan from the heat to prevent overcooking.

Serve the soup in individual bowls and garnish with green onion. Enjoy!

You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container or in the saucepan for up to 3 days. Reheat until warm, but do not let the soup boil.
