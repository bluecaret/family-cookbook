## Steps

1. Place yeast into warm water (105° – 115°). Allow to sit for about five minutes until foamy and bubbly.
2. Preheat oven to 400°
3. In your the mixing bowl of a stand mixer combine flour, sugar, salt, egg, oil and yeast mixture. Knead with dough hook until soft and smooth, about 5 minutes.
4. Divide dough into four pieces and form each piece into a ball.
5. Place in a greased 6 x 8 baking dish and cover. Allow to rise for 10 minutes.
6. Bake in oven for 12-15 minutes or until golden brown.
7. Brush with melted butter after baked and still hot.

## Tips

The rolls will rise best and fastest in a warm location. If your house is cool, turn the light on in your oven and let the rolls rise in the oven. Just don’t forget and turn it on to preheat while the dough is rising in there!!

Rapid rise or instant yeast will both work in this recipe. Instead of proofing the yeast in the water, if using rapid rise yeast, just add it in with the dry ingredients and then add water (water should still be warm)
