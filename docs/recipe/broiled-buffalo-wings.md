## Steps

1. Preheat the broiler. Place the wings in a large pot and fill the pot with water to cover by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then continue to boil for 10 minutes. Drain.
2. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine the cayenne pepper sauce, lemon juice, and broth.
3. Move the wings to a broiler pan and broil 5 to 6 inches from the flame, until the skin begins to blister and brown, 5 to 6 minutes. Turn the wings over and broil until cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes more.
4. Place the wings on a baking sheet, drizzle with the reserved sauce, and toss well to coat. Place the baking sheet under the broiler for 1 minute to heat the wings and sauce together.
5. Serve the broiled Buffalo wings with extra hot sauce on the side, celery sticks, and the blue cheese dip.
