## Steps

1. Mix spices together.

Makes about 5 tbsp. Keeps for up to 6 months.

When making fajitas, add 1 tablespoon seasoning per pound of meat or vegetables, then taste to see if you’d like to add more. Toss the meat or veggies and seasoning together before cooking on the stovetop or grilling.

This seasoning blend contains enough salt that you likely won’t need extra to season meat or vegetables. If you’re on a low-salt diet, you can decrease the salt or leave it out altogether, seasoning to taste.

When using the seasoning in a dish, add the juice of 1/2 to 1 whole lime (to taste) for the best flavor.
