## Steps

1. Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat.
2. Cook the onion and garlic until soft and translucent.
3. Transfer to a blender and add the tomatoes (with juice) and chipotle; puree until smooth.
4. Return to the pot and add the broth. Bring to a simmer.
5. Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Drop the breasts into the liquid whole.
6. Poach them in the soup until cooked all the way through, about 10 minutes. Remove and slice thin just before serving.
7. Preheat the oven to 450°F.
8. Lay the tortilla strips on a baking sheet and bake until lightly brown and crispy.
9. Season the soup with the lime juice; adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, and hot sauce (if using).
10. Divide among 4 warm bowls.
11. Top with the chicken, tortilla strips, avocado, and as many of the other garnishes as you'd like to use.

## Tip

This recipe doesn't call specifically for homemade stock, but if you have the time and some leftover chicken pieces, it's incomparably better than the sodium-soaked store-bought stuff.

Place a pound or two of raw chicken pieces (or a leftover carcass from a roast or rotisserie chicken) in a pot with an onion, a few carrots, and a few stalks of celery. Cover with water and simmer for 90 minutes. Store in the fridge or freezer.
