## Steps

**Marinate the Salmon:** In a bowl, mix lime juice, garlic, ginger, paprika, clove, thyme, black pepper, and salt. Coat the salmon filets with this mixture and let them marinate for at least 30 minutes.

**Cook the Vegetables:** In a skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and habanero pepper. Cook until the vegetables are soft.

**Cook the Salmon:** Push the vegetables to the side of the skillet. Place the marinated salmon filets in the skillet. Cook each side for about 4-5 minutes or until the salmon is cooked through.

**Add Coconut Milk:** Pour the coconut milk over the salmon and vegetables. Let it simmer for a couple of minutes.

**Garnish and Serve:** Garnish with fresh parsley. Serve the salmon with a side of rice or plantains.
