## Steps

### Prepare the squash

1. Gather all the ingredients. Please note that this recipe requires a chill time of at least 1 hour.
2. Use a spoon to remove the seeds from kabocha squash. Cut the kabocha half into 2-inch wedges; Cut the wedges into roughly 2-inch cubes; it doesn't need to be exact as you'll be mashing it later. Tip: If your kabocha is very hard to cut, you can microwave it for about 30 seconds (1000W) to soften it slightly.
3. Next, peel the green skin from the kabocha cubes: Lay each wedge on its flat side and slice or shave off the peel with your knife.
4. Set a steamer basket in a large pot. Pour 1 cup water into the bottom of the pot.
5. Add the peeled kabocha pieces to the steamer basket in a single layer for even cooking. I use all the surface area of the steamer basket, even the curved sides. Cover the pot with a lid and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer and steam for 15 minutes (depending on the size of your kabocha pieces).
6. Squeeze out the liquid from the onion slices with your hands and set aside.
7. After 15 minutes, check if the kabocha is cooked. If a wooden skewer pierces the kabocha easily, it's done. Transfer the kabocha to a bowl or a mortar and pestle.

### Assemble the salad

1. Cut ½ red onion into thin slices. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and rub it into the onion until it wilts a bit.
2. Cut 5 slices ham (optional) into thin strips.
3. Roughly smash the kabocha with the pestle, leaving some chunks for texture.
4. Season with salt and ground black pepper.
5. Add the red onion slices to the bowl and mix well.
6. Add Kewpie and cream cheese. Mix with the kabocha to combine.
7. Add the strips of ham (optional) and mix.
8. Cover the salad with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least one hour. When you're ready to serve, I recommend adding some cream cheese streaks here and there on the top for decoration.

## Store

You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2–3 days or in the freezer for 3 weeks. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight, then enjoy it chilled.
