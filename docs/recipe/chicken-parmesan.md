## Steps

1. Preheat the broiler. Cover the chicken breasts with parchment paper or plastic wrap, and using a meat mallet or a heavy-bottomed pan, pound the chicken until it is uniformly 1⁄4" thick. Season with the salt and pepper.
2. Place the egg whites in a shallow bowl. Mix the bread crumbs, Parmesan, and Italian seasoning on a large plate.
3. Dip each breast into the egg whites to coat both sides and then into the crumb mixture, patting the crumbs so they fully cover the chicken.
4. Heat the oil in a large skillet or sauté pan over medium heat. Cook the chicken for 3 to 4 minutes on the first side before turning. (The crust should be deeply browned and crunchy.)
5. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, then transfer the chicken to a baking sheet.
6. Spoon the tomato sauce over the chicken pieces, then top with the cheese and place underneath the broiler for 2 to 3 minutes or until the cheese is fully melted and bubbling. Serve garnished with basil (if using).

## Tip

Chicken Parm is normally made by shallow frying the breaded meat in a pan, which is exactly what we do here. However, if you want to save time and calories with only the barest sacrifice in flavor, skip the sauté pan and use the oven instead. Bake the chicken breasts in a 400°F oven until the crust is golden and the meat is firm, about 15 minutes.
