## Steps

1. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-low heat.
2. Sauté the onion until translucent, 5-7 minutes. Add the garlic, ginger, tomatoes (with juices), sea salt, pepper, and curry powder. Simmer for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.
3. Nestle the fish in the sauce, cover, and cook until opaque (about 8-10 minutes). Be careful not to overcook. The fish will add its own liquid to the dish.
4. Serve sprinkled with fresh parsley.

## Tips

This is great served over a bed of lightly sautéed kale or spinach.

Serve with a side of rice or barley.

Leftover fish in tomato sauce can be refrigerated for up to 2 days.
