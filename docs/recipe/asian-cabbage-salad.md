## Steps

### Miso Dressing

1. In a small mason jar, combine 1.5 Tbsp miso, 3 Tbsp neutral oil, and 1 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned). If you are not using naturally sweet CRAFT MISO by Hikari Miso, add 1/2 tsp sugar per 3 Tbsp miso of a different type. Then, close the lid tightly and shake well until the miso is completely dissolved. Store in the refrigerator until ready to use.

### Sesame Dressing

1. Put sesame seeds in a frying pan and toast them on low heat. When 2-3 sesame seeds start popping, remove from the heat.
2. Grind the toasted sesame seeds with a mortar and pestle until smooth.
3. Combine all the ingredients in a bowl and whisk everything together.

### Cabbage Salad

1. Discard the core of green and red cabbage. Thinly slice the cabbage or shred it using a cabbage slicer.
2. Peel 1 carrots. Using a julienne peeler, make long, thin julienned strips with the carrot. When they are too long, cut the long strips in half or thirds into 2-inch pieces. If you have a regular vegetable peeler, peel the carrot into thin sheets, then cut the sheets into long, thin julienned strips.
3. Chop 5 sprigs cilantro (coriander) and discard the stems.
4. In a large salad bowl, place the green cabbage, red cabbage, carrot, cilantro, 0.5 cup shelled edamame, and 1/8 cup peanuts. If you‘re not serving the salad right away, cover it with plastic and refrigerate it for up to 24 hours.

About 10 minutes before serving, take out the Miso Dressing from the refrigerator and shake well. Drizzle two-thirds of the dressing over the salad and toss together. Taste the salad and add more dressing, if needed.

### Store

You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and keep them in the refrigerator. If dressed already, the salad lasts for a day (if longer, it gets wilted). If not dressed yet, it can last a bit longer. I recommend keeping the salad and dressing separately and tossing only the amount you‘ll consume.
