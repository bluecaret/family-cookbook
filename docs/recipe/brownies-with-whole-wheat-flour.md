## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease 7x11 inch baking, or any other tin you may have.
2. In a bowl put the butter, sugar, oil. Put it in a water bath or you can melt the butter in a microwave bowl with the sugar and oil.
3. Add the eggs, and combine the mixture thoroughly.
4. Combine all the dry ingredients, sieve them, and add them to the wet ingredients. Mix it thoroughly.
5. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
6. Bake for 25-35 minutes, when you touch the brownies in the center they should be still soft. Everyone's oven is different so bake accordingly.
7. Remove from the oven and allow it to cool at room temperature before removing from the baking tray.

## Adjustments to recipe

- Add ground flax seed with the dry ingredients for an increase in fiber.
- Substitute brown sugar for Stevia (Possbily half as much? Has not been tested.)
- Try lowering the amount of cocoa powder a bit for a less rich brownie.
