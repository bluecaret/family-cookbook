## Steps

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and line a 8x4 inch loaf pan with parchment paper.
2. Place the butter in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in the microwave until melted (or melt butter over the stove).
3. Add in both sugars and whisk until the mixture pulls away easily from the sides of the bowl as you mix, with a paste-like consistency.
4. Whisk in the egg and vanilla extract.
5. Add flour, cocoa powder, and salt, then whisk until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.
6. Pour the batter into the parchment-lined pan, spreading it around in an even layer and bake for 26-36 minutes. If using a glass baking dish instead of aluminium, the brownies will take longer to bake.

The top should be crackly and a toothpick inserted in the middle should come out with just a few wet crumbs on it, but not covered in batter or completely clean. The batter should also not be jiggly in the pan.

Let the brownies cool completely in the pan before slicing.

## Adjustments to recipe

- Add ground flax seed with the dry ingredients for an increase in fiber.
- Substitute brown sugar for Stevia (Possbily half as much? Has not been tested.)
- Try lowering the amount of cocoa powder a bit for a less rich brownie.
