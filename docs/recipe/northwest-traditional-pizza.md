## Steps

1. Sauce and top the pizza with cheese, basil, pepperoni and sausage.
2. Bake for 7 minutes in a wood-fired oven at 625°.
3. Remove from oven and place on a screen for 4 minutes to release built-up steam.
4. Finish with drizzle of honey cream cheese sauce, red pepper flakes and Parmesan.

### Honey cream cheese

Mix 6 parts cream cheese, 8 parts heavy cream, 1 part honey, and pinch of salt. Whisk well and place in a squeeze bottle.

## About the pizza

The Northwest Traditional is much more than a standard pepperoni-and-sausage pizza, according to its creators at Farrelli’s Pizza, which has multiple locations in Washington State. “For the crust, we took our housemade dough and added an 18-hour room-temperature fermentation,” a company statement reads. “This extra step gave us a lighter, crispier crust with some big fermentation flavor. We also added two extra hours of proofing time. The mozzarella gives the pizza a very smooth and creamy texture, while the provolone adds a very sharp cheese flavor, and the freshly grated Parmesan lends a nutty, salty component. Some people might think this is a simple two-topping pepperoni-and-sausage pizza, but, to us, it is a recipe that shows our growth over 20 years and our commitment to quality and continuous improvement.”
