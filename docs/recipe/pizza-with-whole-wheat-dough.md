## Steps

1. In a large bowl, dissolve the honey or sugar in warm water, and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, until the mixture is frothy.
2. Stir in the olive oil, whole wheat flour, seeds, and salt until the dough begins to form. Let sit for 5 minutes to hydrate.
3. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.
4. Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1-2 hours.
5. Once the dough has risen, punch it down and turn it out onto a floured surface. Divide it into two balls for two thin crusts, or leave it whole for one thicker crust.
6. Roll out the dough to your desired thickness and place it on a pizza stone or baking sheet.
7. Par-bake at 300° till crust just starts to brown.
8. Add toppings and bake at 475° for 7-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.
