## Steps

1. In a medium saucepan, bring to a boil 11‚ÅÑ2 cups water. Add rice and sea salt. Reduce heat to low, cover
   and allow to simmer for about 45 minutes, until rice is cooked.
2. While rice is cooking, heat coconut oil over medium heat in a large skillet. Add onions and cook,
   stirring, until softened.
3. Add garlic and cook for 1 more minute.
4. Add canned tomatoes (with their juices), chicken, and curry powder. Cook over low heat, stirring, for
   about 15-20 minutes, until chicken is thoroughly cooked and mixture is thick.
5. Stir in coconut milk (mixed with water) and cook for 5 more minutes.
6. Serve immediately with rice, topped with a sprinkle of cinnamon and garnished with basil.

**Tips:** Alternatively, instead of coconut milk mixed with water, you could use 1/4 cup
light (canned) coconut milk.
