## Steps

1. In a large bowl, dissolve the honey or sugar in warm water, and sprinkle the yeast over the top. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, until the mixture is frothy.
2. Stir in the olive oil, whole wheat flour, seeds, and salt until the dough begins to form.
3. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.
4. Place the dough in a well-oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1-2 hours.
5. Once the dough has risen, punch it down and turn it out onto a floured surface. Divide it into two balls for two thin crusts, or leave it whole for one thicker crust.
6. Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). Roll out the dough to your desired thickness and place it on a pizza stone or baking sheet.
7. Add your favorite toppings and bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.
