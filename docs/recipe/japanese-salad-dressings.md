## Steps

### Before you start

You can whisk all the ingredients in a mixing bowl, but I highly recommend getting 8-oz mason jars or 16-oz mason jars. You can put all your ingredients in a jar with a lid and shake vigorously until everything has emulsified. If you have leftover dressing, you can store it directly in the refrigerator!

### Italian Dressing

1. Combine all the ingredients in a mason jar: ½ cup extra virgin olive oil, ¼ cup white wine vinegar, ½ tsp sugar, 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper, 1 clove garlic (crushed or minced), ¼ tsp dried basil, and ¼ tsp dried parsley. Shake really well until everything has emulsified.

### French Vinaigrette Dressing

1. Combine all the ingredients in a mason jar: ½ cup neutral oil, ¼ cup white wine vinegar, 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper, and ½ tsp sugar. Shake really well until everything has emulsified.

### Shoyu Dressing (Soy sauce dressing)

1. Combine all the ingredients in a mason jar: ½ cup neutral oil, ¼ cup rice vinegar (unseasoned), 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper, and ½ tsp sugar. Shake really well until everything has emulsified.

### Chuka Dessing (Chinese-style dressing)

1. Combine all the ingredients in a mason jar: 6 Tbsp neutral oil, 2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil, 4 Tbsp rice vinegar (unseasoned), 2 Tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt, ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper, ½ tsp sugar, and1 tsp toasted white sesame seeds. Shake really well until everything has emulsified.

### Serve and store

1. Serve on your favorite salad and enjoy! Cover the leftovers and refrigerate for 7 to 10 days. When your dressing solidifies in the refrigerator, simply let it rest at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes or microwave very briefly (about 15–20 seconds) to liquify the oil again. Whisk or shake well and serve!

## Notes

Some variations:

- Shoyu Dressing: grated ginger, grated daikon, yuzu kosho, and umeboshi plum.
- Chuka Dressing: grated ginger, minced garlic, Tobanjiang, red chili.

A general rule of thumb when making dressings is 1 part vinegar to 2 parts oil.
