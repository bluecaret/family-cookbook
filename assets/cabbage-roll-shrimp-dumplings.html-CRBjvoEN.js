Boil the leaves in the water for 2½ minutes until soft and pliable.</li><li>Remove the leaves from the pot and set aside to cool.</li><li>While the leaves are cooling, place carrot, green onions, garlic, and ginger in a food processor, and process until they are chopped into small pieces.</li><li>Add shrimp, sesame oil, soy sauce, salt, and pepper, and pulse until chopped and combined. If you don&#39;t have a food processor, you can chop everything into small pieces with a sharp knife and mix together in a bowl.</li><li>Use the napa cabbage leaves to roll up the filling: Place a leaf flat on a plate or a cutting board then add about 3 tbsp of the filling at the base of the cabbage. Roll the cabbage to encase the filling. You can fold up the sides to close them up but it&#39;s not necessary.</li><li>Once all the cabbage rolls are made, heat 1 tbsp of oil in a large skillet over medium high heat.</li><li>Once hot, add cabbage rolls in a single layer. You&#39;ll work in 2-3 batches. Cook for 3 minutes, flip then cook for another 3 minutes until the filling is cooked through and the leaves are browned. Repeat with the remaining oil and cabbage rolls.</li><li>Combine all ingredients for the dipping sauce in a small bowl.</li><li>Garnish with toasted sesame seeds, and enjoy warm with dipping sauce.</li></ol><p>Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days.</p>',3),o=[n];function s(r,p){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const h=e(l,[["render",s],["__file","cabbage-roll-shrimp-dumplings.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/recipe/cabbage-roll-shrimp-dumplings.html","title":"Cabbage Roll Shrimp Dumplings","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Cabbage Roll Shrimp Dumplings","author":"What Great Grandma Ate @ FoodSocial","authorUrl":"https://foodsocial.io/recipe/pan-fried-cabbage-roll-shrimp-dumplings/","image":"cabbage-roll-shrimp-dumplings.jpg","category":["Japanese"],"tag":["main","cabbage","napa","shrimp"],"excerpt":"These pan fried cabbage rolls are a quick and easy way to enjoy shrimp dumpling flavor.
