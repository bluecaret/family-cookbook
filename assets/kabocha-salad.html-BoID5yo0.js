Please note that this recipe requires a chill time of at least 1 hour.</li><li>Use a spoon to remove the seeds from kabocha squash. Cut the kabocha half into 2-inch wedges; Cut the wedges into roughly 2-inch cubes; it doesn&#39;t need to be exact as you&#39;ll be mashing it later. Tip: If your kabocha is very hard to cut, you can microwave it for about 30 seconds (1000W) to soften it slightly.</li><li>Next, peel the green skin from the kabocha cubes: Lay each wedge on its flat side and slice or shave off the peel with your knife.</li><li>Set a steamer basket in a large pot. Pour 1 cup water into the bottom of the pot.</li><li>Add the peeled kabocha pieces to the steamer basket in a single layer for even cooking. I use all the surface area of the steamer basket, even the curved sides. Cover the pot with a lid and bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Lower the heat to maintain a simmer and steam for 15 minutes (depending on the size of your kabocha pieces).</li><li>Squeeze out the liquid from the onion slices with your hands and set aside.</li><li>After 15 minutes, check if the kabocha is cooked. If a wooden skewer pierces the kabocha easily, it&#39;s done. Transfer the kabocha to a bowl or a mortar and pestle.</li></ol><h3 id="assemble-the-salad" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#assemble-the-salad"><span>Assemble the salad</span></a></h3><ol><li>Cut ½ red onion into thin slices. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and rub it into the onion until it wilts a bit.</li><li>Cut 5 slices ham (optional) into thin strips.</li><li>Roughly smash the kabocha with the pestle, leaving some chunks for texture.</li><li>Season with salt and ground black pepper.</li><li>Add the red onion slices to the bowl and mix well.</li><li>Add Kewpie and cream cheese. Mix with the kabocha to combine.</li><li>Add the strips of ham (optional) and mix.</li><li>Cover the salad with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least one hour. When you&#39;re ready to serve, I recommend adding some cream cheese streaks here and there on the top for decoration.</li></ol><h2 id="store" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#store"><span>Store</span></a></h2><p>You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2–3 days or in the freezer for 3 weeks.
