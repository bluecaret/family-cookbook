These days kombu is much cleaner and you don‘t really have to wipe it. Never wash it under running water!</li><li>In a donabe (Japanese clay pot), put 1 piece kombu (dried kelp) and 1-1/2 to 2 cups water. Let the kombu soak for 1 to 2 hours. If you‘re short on time, you can steep the water with kombu slowly over the lowest heat.</li></ol><h3 id="prepare-the-sauce" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prepare-the-sauce"><span>Prepare the sauce</span></a></h3><ol><li>Meanwhile, make the sauce.

You don’t have to strain it; it’s okay if some bonito flakes go into the sauce.</li></ol><p>These leftover bonito flakes have a nice flavor and you can use it as filling for Okaka Onigiri or to make Homemade Furikake (rice seasoning).</p><h3 id="prepare-the-hot-tofu" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prepare-the-hot-tofu"><span>Prepare the hot tofu</span></a></h3><ol><li>When the kombu dashi is ready (after 1–2 hours), bring the dashi to a boil on medium heat. If you were slowly heating up the kombu dashi (because you didn‘t have time to soak for 1–2 hours), bring it to a boil, too. Once boiling, add 1 Tbsp sake and 1/4 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt.</li><li>When boiling again, cut 1 medium-firm tofu (momen dofu) to any size you like (whole tofu, halves, or 6 pieces, for example) and put it in the kombu dashi.</li><li>When the tofu is heated through, after several minutes, add the mitsuba (Japanese parsley). If you plan to use other vegetables, make sure are they cooked through.</li><li>While the tofu is hot, serve it with the sauce and add the optional toppings of your choice, such as chopped green onion/scallion, grated ginger, shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) and yuzu kosho (Japanese citrus chili paste).</li></ol><h2 id="nutrition-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nutrition-facts"><span>Nutrition Facts</span></a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Nutrition</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Calories</td><td>178</td></tr><tr><td>Total Fat</td><td>9g</td></tr><tr><td>Sodium</td><td>165mg</td></tr><tr><td>Carbohydrates</td><td>5g</td></tr><tr><td>Fiber</td><td>2g</td></tr><tr><td>Sugar</td><td>1g</td></tr><tr><td>Potassium</td><td>24mg</td></tr><tr><td>Protein</td><td>18g</td></tr><tr><td>Vitamin A</td><td>1 IU</td></tr><tr><td>Vitamin C</td><td>1mg</td></tr><tr><td>Calcium</td><td>276mg</td></tr><tr><td>Iron</td><td>2mg</td></tr></tbody></table>',10),n=[s];function r(h,u){return a(),e("div",null,n)}const d=t(i,[["render",r],["__file","hot-tofu-yudofu.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/recipe/hot-tofu-yudofu.html","title":"Hot Tofu (Yudofu)","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Hot Tofu (Yudofu)","author":"Just One Cookbook","authorUrl":"https://www.justonecookbook.com/hot-tofu-yudofu/","image":"hot-tofu-yudofu.jpg","category":["Japanese"],"tag":["side","main","tofu","vegan"],"excerpt":"With just tofu and kombu stock, you can enjoy protein-rich and nourishing Hot Tofu (Yudofu) at home.
