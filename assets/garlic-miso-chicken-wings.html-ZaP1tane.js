Now, gather all the ingredients.</li><li>In a resealable plastic bag, combine 4 cloves garlic (minced; I use a garlic press), 2 Tbsp miso, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, and 2 Tbsp mirin. Mix it together well to dissolve the miso.</li><li>Pat dry 1 lb chicken wings (flats/drumettes) with paper towels and prick the skin with a fork. I recommend this extra step especially if you‘re using skin-on and bone-in chicken. Transfer the wings to the resealable plastic bag.</li><li>Rub the wings really well from outside the bag, coating them with the marinade. Release the air from the bag and seal. Keep the wings in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours (preferably overnight) or up to a day; if you are using drumsticks, you can marinate for 1–2 days.</li></ol><h3 id="baking-method" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#baking-method"><span>Baking method</span></a></h3><ol><li>To cook the wings, you can either bake or broil them (see the next section). To bake, preheat the oven to 425ºF (220ºC) with the rack in the middle position. Meanwhile, remove the chicken wings from the refrigerator and leave at room temperature for 15 minutes. Line the baking sheet with aluminum foil (for easier clean up) and place an oven-safe wire rack on top.</li><li>After 15 minutes, remove as much of the marinade as possible from the chicken since miso burns easily. Place the chicken on the wire rack skin side down. Bake at 425ºF (220ºC) for 45 minutes total. (If you‘re using other chicken parts, see the instructions below for baking times.)</li><li>After 30 minutes, flip the wings. Put them back in the oven for another 15 minutes.</li><li>Monitor the cooking time; the chicken is cooked through when the internal temperature is 165ºF (74ºC). Serve immediately with optional Japanese Kewpie mayonnaise and shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) on the side for dipping.</li></ol><h3 id="broil-method" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#broil-method"><span>Broil method</span></a></h3><ol><li>Set the oven broiler to High (550ºF/288ºC) for 3 minutes before cooking. Place the baking sheet in the middle rack of the oven, about 8 inches (20 cm) away from the heating element. Cook for 9–10 minutes, until nicely browned and crispy, and then flip the chicken to cook the other side (skin side) for another 9–10 minutes. Watch the chicken carefully so it doesn‘t burn; if your oven is small/strong, try broiling at Medium (500ºF/260ºC) or lower the rack. The chicken is cooked through when the internal temperature is 165ºF (74ºC).</li></ol><h3 id="if-cooking-other-parts-of-chicken" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#if-cooking-other-parts-of-chicken"><span>If cooking other parts of chicken</span></a></h3><p>For <strong>boneless chicken thighs or breasts</strong>: Bake for 30–40 minutes (depending on the part and thickness). Turn over the chicken halfway during the cooking process.</p><p>For <strong>chicken drumsticks</strong>: Bake for 45–50 minutes, or until the internal temperature is 165ºF (74ºC). Turn over the chicken halfway during the cooking process.</p><h2 id="nutrition-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nutrition-facts"><span>Nutrition Facts</span></a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Nutrition</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Calories</td><td>213</td></tr><tr><td>Total Fat</td><td>13g</td></tr><tr><td>Sodium</td><td>631mg</td></tr><tr><td>Carbohydrates</td><td>5g</td></tr><tr><td>Fiber</td><td>1g</td></tr><tr><td>Sugar</td><td>2g</td></tr><tr><td>Potassium</td><td>162mg</td></tr><tr><td>Protein</td><td>16g</td></tr><tr><td>Vitamin A</td><td>122IU</td></tr><tr><td>Vitamin C</td><td>2mg</td></tr><tr><td>Calcium</td><td>25mg</td></tr><tr><td>Iron</td><td>1mg</td></tr></tbody></table>',11),r=[a];function s(h,c){return i(),t("div",null,r)}const d=e(o,[["render",s],["__file","garlic-miso-chicken-wings.html.vue"]]),m=JSON.parse('{"path":"/recipe/garlic-miso-chicken-wings.html","title":"Garlic Miso Chicken Wings","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Garlic Miso Chicken Wings","author":"Just One Cookbook","authorUrl":"https://www.justonecookbook.com/garlic-miso-chicken-wings/","image":"garlic-miso-chicken-wings.jpg","category":["Japanese"],"tag":["main","chicken"],"excerpt":"Marinated in a delicious savory sauce, baked Garlic Miso Chicken Wings are crispy on the outside and juicy and succulent inside.","noRecipe":["Marinate chicken wings in minced garlic, miso, soy sauce, mirin for at least 6 hours.","Remove marinade from chicken as miso burns.","Place chicken skin side down on pan.","Broil on middle rack for 9-10 minutes.","Flip, then cook another 9-10 minutes."],"servings":2,"time":{"prep":"5 mins","rest":"5 mins","cook":"5 mins","total":"15 mins"},"ingredients":[{"quantity":1,"unit":"lb","label":"chicken wings"},{"quantity":4,"unit":"cloves","label":"garlic, minced"},{"quantity":2,"unit":"tbsp","label":"miso"},{"quantity":2,"unit":"tbsp","label":"soy sauce"},{"quantity":2,"unit":"tbsp","label":"mirin"},{"heading":"For serving","ingredients":[{"label":"shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice)"},{"label":"Kewpie mayonnaise"}]}]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Steps","slug":"steps","link":"#steps","children":[{"level":3,"title":"Baking method","slug":"baking-method","link":"#baking-method","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"Broil method","slug":"broil-method","link":"#broil-method","children":[]},{"level":3,"title":"If cooking other parts of chicken","slug":"if-cooking-other-parts-of-chicken","link":"#if-cooking-other-parts-of-chicken","children":[]}]},{"level":2,"title":"Nutrition Facts","slug":"nutrition-facts","link":"#nutrition-facts","children":[]}]}');export{d as comp,m as data};
