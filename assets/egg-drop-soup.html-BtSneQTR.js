I recommend making this dish right before you serve.</li><li>Beat egg in a bowl or measuring cup. Cut green onion/scallion into thin, round pieces.</li><li>In a small bowl, mix together 2 tsp water and 1 tsp potato starch or cornstarch to make a slurry. As the starch tends to sink to the bottom of the bowl, you will need to mix it again right before you use it.</li><li>To a saucepan, add dashi (Japanese soup stock), sake, and salt.</li><li>Add soy sauce. Check the flavor and adjust with more salt, if needed. Then, bring it to a simmer on medium heat. When simmering, give the slurry mixture another whisk and add it to the dashi.</li><li>Stir quickly to distribute the slurry into the dashi. Bring it to a simmer.</li><li>Once simmering, slowly pour a thin stream of the beaten egg into the soup in circular pattern. Let the egg sit for 20–25 seconds. Then, remove the saucepan from the heat to prevent overcooking.</li></ol><p>Serve the soup in individual bowls and garnish with green onion. Enjoy!</p><p>You can keep the leftovers in an airtight container or in the saucepan for up to 3 days. Reheat until warm, but do not let the soup boil.</p><h2 id="nutrition-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nutrition-facts"><span>Nutrition Facts</span></a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Nutrition</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Calories</td><td>52</td></tr><tr><td>Total Fat</td><td>2g</td></tr><tr><td>Sodium</td><td>345mg</td></tr><tr><td>Carbohydrates</td><td>2g</td></tr><tr><td>Fiber</td><td>1g</td></tr><tr><td>Sugar</td><td>1g</td></tr><tr><td>Potassium</td><td>70mg</td></tr><tr><td>Protein</td><td>4g</td></tr><tr><td>Vitamin A</td><td>195IU</td></tr><tr><td>Vitamin C</td><td>1mg</td></tr><tr><td>Calcium</td><td>21mg</td></tr><tr><td>Iron</td><td>1mg</td></tr></tbody></table>',6),n=[r];function s(d,l){return i(),e("div",null,n)}const h=t(o,[["render",s],["__file","egg-drop-soup.html.vue"]]),p=JSON.parse('{"path":"/recipe/egg-drop-soup.html","title":"Egg Drop Soup (Kakitamajiru)","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Egg Drop Soup (Kakitamajiru)","author":"Just One Cookbook","authorUrl":"https://www.justonecookbook.com/kakitamajiru-japanese-egg-drop-soup/","image":"egg-drop-soup.jpg","category":["Japanese"],"tag":["side","soup","egg"],"excerpt":"Made with dashi broth and fluffy egg ribbons, it is everything you crave in a bowl of soup: delicate, flavorful, and restorative.","noRecipe":["Beat egg in bowl.","Heat dashi, soy sauce, optionally mirin, in pan.","When simmering, add cornstarch slurry.","Slowly pour egg in pan while stirring.","Garnish with green onion."],"servings":2,"time":{"prep":"5 mins","cook":"10 mins","total":"15 mins"},"ingredients":[{"quantity":1,"unit":"large","label":"egg"},{"quantity":2,"unit":"tsp","label":"water"},{"quantity":1,"unit":"tsp","label":"potato starch or cornstarch"},{"quantity":2,"unit":"cups","label":"dashi"},{"quantity":2,"unit":"tsp","label":"sake"},{"quantity":"¼","unit":"tsp","label":"salt"},{"quantity":1,"unit":"tsp","label":"soy sauce"},{"quantity":1,"unit":"stalk","label":"green onion"}]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Steps","slug":"steps","link":"#steps","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Nutrition Facts","slug":"nutrition-facts","link":"#nutrition-facts","children":[]}]}');export{h as comp,p as data};
