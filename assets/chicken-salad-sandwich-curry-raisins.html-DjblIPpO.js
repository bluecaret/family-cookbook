One thing they nearly all have in common is that distinctive yellow tinge, which comes from turmeric, perhaps the world&#39;s healthiest spice. Studies have shown turmeric&#39;s vast antioxidant portfolio to be an effective defense against arthritis, prostate and colon cancers, and various other diseases. Get your dose by rubbing curry onto chicken and fish; mixing with yogurt, garlic, and ginger for a sauce or dip; or coating roasted nuts.</p><h2 id="nutrition-facts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#nutrition-facts"><span>Nutrition Facts</span></a></h2><table><thead><tr><th>Nutrition</th><th>Amount</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Calories</td><td>440</td></tr><tr><td>Total Fat</td><td>15g</td></tr><tr><td>Sodium</td><td>510mg</td></tr></tbody></table>',6),s=[r];function l(c,o){return a(),e("div",null,s)}const h=t(n,[["render",l],["__file","chicken-salad-sandwich-curry-raisins.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/recipe/chicken-salad-sandwich-curry-raisins.html","title":"Chicken Curry Salad Sandwich","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Chicken Curry Salad Sandwich","author":"Cook This Not That (page 146)","authorUrl":"https://www.eatthis.com/chicken-salad-sandwich-recipe/","image":"chicken-salad-sandwich-curry-raisins.webp","category":["American"],"tag":["side"],"excerpt":"Healthy chicken salad with curry powder and raisins on a sandwich.","ingredients":[{"quantity":3,"unit":"tbsp","label":"golden raisins"},{"quantity":3,"unit":"cups","label":"chicken, chopped"},{"quantity":2,"unit":"stalks","label":"celery, thinly sliced"},{"quantity":"½","label":"onion, diced"},{"quantity":1,"label":"carrot, shredded"},{"quantity":"½","unit":"tsp","label":"curry powder"},{"quantity":"¼","unit":"cup","label":"olive oil mayonnaise"},{"label":"salt and pepper to taste"},{"quantity":4,"unit":"large","label":"lettuce leaves (romaine, iceberg, etc.)"},{"quantity":8,"unit":"slices","label":"whole-grain bread"},{"quantity":2,"unit":"medium","label":"tomatoes, sliced"}]},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Steps","slug":"steps","link":"#steps","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Tip","slug":"tip","link":"#tip","children":[]},{"level":2,"title":"Nutrition Facts","slug":"nutrition-facts","link":"#nutrition-facts","children":[]}]}');export{h as comp,u as data};
