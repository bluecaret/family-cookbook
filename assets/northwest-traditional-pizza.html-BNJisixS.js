We also added two extra hours of proofing time. The mozzarella gives the pizza a very smooth and creamy texture, while the provolone adds a very sharp cheese flavor, and the freshly grated Parmesan lends a nutty, salty component. Some people might think this is a simple two-topping pepperoni-and-sausage pizza, but, to us, it is a recipe that shows our growth over 20 years and our commitment to quality and continuous improvement.”</p>',6),o=[s];function r(l,h){return t(),a("div",null,o)}const c=e(n,[["render",r],["__file","northwest-traditional-pizza.html.vue"]]),d=JSON.parse(`{"path":"/recipe/northwest-traditional-pizza.html","title":"Northwest Traditional Pizza","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Northwest Traditional Pizza","author":"PMQ Pizza (Inspired by Farrelli's Pizza)","authorUrl":"https://www.pmq.com/the-northwest-traditional/","image":"northwest-traditional-pizza.jpg","category":["American"],"tag":["main"],"excerpt":"This is much more than a standard pepperoni-and-sausage pizza.
