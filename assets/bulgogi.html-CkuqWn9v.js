(If you can’t get thinly sliced beef, get yourself some steak and freeze for about 30 minutes. When it’s partially frozen, it will be a lot easier to slice.) Transfer to a mixing bowl.</li><li>To make the marinade, in a small container, add the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, mirin, minced garlic, sesame oil, and black pepper to taste. Mix together until the sugar is dissolved.</li><li>Pour it over the beef and gently massage it. Cover and let it marinate in the fridge for 15 minutes or overnight.</li></ol><h3 id="prep-vegetables" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#prep-vegetables"><span>Prep vegetables</span></a></h3><ol><li>Cut the green onions into strips about 2 inches (5 cm) long. (If the white parts of the green onions are too thick, you can cut them in half lengthwise.)</li><li>Optionally, thinly slice some white parts of the green onions and add them to the marinade. Or make green onion oil before you cook the beef. That will upgrade your bulgogi.</li><li>Thinly slice the onion. Cut the carrot into thin matchsticks.</li></ol><h3 id="cook-bulgogi" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#cook-bulgogi"><span>Cook Bulgogi</span></a></h3><ol><li>In a wok (or pan), add 1 tablespoon of oil. Heat it over medium heat. Once the oil is heated, add half of the green onions, half of the onion, and half of the carrot. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes.</li><li>Once the vegetables start to soften, increase the heat to medium-high. Add half of the beef. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until the beef is cooked through.</li><li>Place it on a serving plate. (Repeat with the remaining ingredients.) Sprinkle with sesame seeds. Serve with hot rice, lettuce, kimchi, and ssamjang (Korean dipping sauce).</li><li>Or you can make a beautiful rice bowl: Get yourself a small ttukbaegi (Korean clay pot) or cast iron pan. Lightly coat it with some sesame oil to prevent any sticking. Add some rice and bulgogi. Put it back on the stovetop and place it over low heat. Once you hear the sizzle, turn the heat off. Garnish with greens, soft-boiled egg (if using), green onions, sesame seeds, and cherry tomatoes (if using). Enjoy!</li></ol><h2 id="notes" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#notes"><span>Notes</span></a></h2><p>Substitute oyster sauce by doubling the soy sauce.</p><p>I cooked in two batches to get the best result, but if you’re cooking for a family and this sounds like a hassle, you can totally cook them all at once. Don’t worry!</p><p>You can store any marinated, uncooked bulgogi in the fridge for up to 3 days or freeze it.</p>',11),l=[n];function s(r,h){return a(),t("div",null,l)}const u=e(o,[["render",s],["__file","bulgogi.html.vue"]]),g=JSON.parse('{"path":"/recipe/bulgogi.html","title":"Bulgogi (Korean BBQ Beef)","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":"Bulgogi (Korean BBQ Beef)","author":"Aaron and Claire","authorUrl":"https://aaronandclaire.com/bulgogi-korean-bbq-beef/","image":"bulgogi.jpg","category":["Korean"],"tag":["main","beef"],"excerpt":"Bulgogi is one of the most iconic Korean foods of all time.
